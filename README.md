# AWSW-WordClock-Windows-setup-script

AWSW WordClock automatic Windows setup script

Automatic Arduino IDE and library setup for WordClock by AWSW

The script can be used with Windows 10 and Windows 11 and will be installing Arduino IDE, required libraries and download code for your WordClock automatically.

The installation is done hard! This meaans existing Arduino IDE or library installations get removed hard !
This ensures that the compile will work after this script was used but can cause the removal of old libraries !

IMPORTANT: You are using this script at your own risk. The manual way to do this is well described too !

Everythng will be downloaded and installed for you... You just need to wait until the process is finished... =)
